# Gmail - Electron

## Description
This is my first attempt at creating an Electron application. I really love using the Gmail web interface with the simplify gmail extension, but I do not like it being another tab in the browser. So, this is my attempt at breaking it out into it's own application.

## To Run:

1. Clone repository
2. Run ```npm install```
3. Run ```npm start```
